title: Welcome to this computer vision based blog!
---

Welcome on my personal computer vision blog which will shed a light on the current research I am performing and everything related to that. For about 2 years I have been actively develloping OpenCV based computer vision software. Besides that I took an active role in moderating the OpenCV Q&A forum and participating in solving bugs related to the opensource package. Many of the posts I will be writing will talk about interesting things I discovered while doing this.

For now this website is mainly used for providing in interface with my current research, like the publications and results I have from several projects. Once I get everything into place and I have found my way around Jekyll programming, I will start putting up my first blog posts. In the meanwhile enjoy this first snapshot of a orchid detector I built for research purposes.

If you would be interested in any of the work I am doing, feel free to send me an e-mail!

Signing off,

Steven
