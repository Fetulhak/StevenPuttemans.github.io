title: Publications updated!
---

Since I went to Rome last week to present my latest research at VISIGRAPP2016, I have decided to update the information on my publications page. For each publication you can now find a link to the original paper and a link to the given presentation (oral/poster). If you would have any more questions about the content of those, do not hesitate to contact me for more information.
