### TOBCAT project results: Applying object categorisation techniques in real-life industrial cases

*Published in DSP Valley Newsletter, volume 15, issue 4, page 9*

In this article the results of the IWT-TETRA project TOBCAT (Industrial applications of object categorization techniques) are announced to the members of the DSP Valley community. It illustrates real-life industrial applications where the developped software introduced a significant help into solving the problem proposed.

### TOBCAT: Industrial applications of object categorization techniques

*Published in DSP Valley Newsletter, volume 14, issue 3, page 9-12*

In this article the IWT-TETRA project TOBCAT (Industrial applications of object categorization techniques) is introduced to the members of the DSP Valley community. This project focusses on translating state-of-the-art object categorization algorithms, develloped in academic context, towards real life, ready to use industrial applications. With this project we want compagnies to be able to apply robust object detection in these industrial situations, being able to cope with intra-class variation.
